## Programming Template

Use this template to develop a program in Swift 6 on a Linux host.

## Actions

![Action buttons](.devcontainer/actions.jpg)

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Build and Run**: build and run the code in the `Sources` folder
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Format**: on first click, installs swift-format. After that, reformats your code
- üñ•Ô∏è **New Terminal**: open a terminal window to run a Linux command
- üóëÔ∏è **Kill All Terminals**: closes all terminal windows
- üëÅÔ∏è **Kaiako Mode**: makes the text larger so your kaiako can read your code more easily on your computer

## Starting new projects

When you create new projects, you must **create a new branch**. This is because Swift requires code to be located in the `main.swift` file located in the `Sources` folder.

Creating a new branch allows you to have multiple versions of the `main.swift` file which you can switch between.

To create a new branch:

1. At the bottom of the window, click on the **Source Control** button (between the Codespaces button and the refresh icon). It probably says `main` right now
2. At the top of the screen, click on **Create new branch from‚Ä¶**, then click `origin/main`
3. Type a meaningful name for your branch. For example, `loops` or `task2`
   - Don't include spaces, symbols (aside from dashes or underscores), or capital letters in the name

## Switch to another project

1. At the bottom of the window, click on the **Source Control** button.
2. Click on your previous project.
   - If you receive an error, you may need to wait until all your changes in your current branch have been committed and pushed first.
